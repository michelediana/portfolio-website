  <h2>UX Designer</h2>
  <p>Hello, my name is Michele Diana - or Mike for short. I currently live in the New York City area.
    I'm a UX designer with a background in graphic design, and passionate about creating simple functionality and meaningful interaction
    for users. I am continuously keeping up with the latest trends and techniques in UX/UI design. My background in creative marketing
    allows me to understand users’ needs and design in their best interests. I'm currently seeking UX/UI opportunities. Let's get in
