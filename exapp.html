        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Enable anyone, anywhere to instantly chat with an expert in virtually any field.</p>
        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>My role on this project was to be the UX designer. I conducted user interviews,
          user research used the best practices, collected data from research information,
          prioritized content, created wireframes, developed prototypes for user testings
          and designed user-interface.</p>

       <h2>1 Problem Statement</h2>
       <p>I began this project by creating a problem statement.
          I used the double diamond strategy to start my research process and
          understand what problems I will face when building this application.
          The lessons I learned from this step was how to point out pain points
          in applications and approach this project with empathy for potential users.</p>
       <h2>2 Competitive Analysis</h2>
       <p>I conducted competitive research from other apps and websites to observe what
         other competitors are doing. I found their strengths and marketing strategies,
         and this allowed me to focus on areas where users are motivated to complete their
         tasks. In this task, I learned how to dive deep into a competitor's website and
         application to understand how to dissect them into a chart where I can view an entire
         break down of each website of applications. This step was vital to my process, and I
         was able to understand what worked well and how to improve in weak areas to satisfy users'
         needs. </p>
      <h2>3 User Personas</h2>
      <p>Collecting Data analysis, user interviews, and research information I
         was able to create user personas which reflects my target audience.</p>
      <h2>4 User Flows</h2>
      <p>I created user flows to understand how users would use the app and how to
         create the least amount of friction as possible.</p>
      <h2>5 Information Architect</h2>
      <p>From the results of my user tests, I’m able to create an information architecture
         where a user would cognitively find pages in the app without friction and motivate them
         to complete their tasks.</p>
      <h2>6 Wireframes</h2>
      <p>I created med-fidelity using Balsamiq to gain a visual where elements of the
         app will be placed. Later I created a hi-fidelity to understand the visual
         elements and observed how the elements would work together.</p>
      <h2>7 User Testing</h2>
      <p>After creating my prototype, I tested the app with real users to understand
         their pain points and what motivates them. Conducted interviews in person using
         my iPhone 7 to record the interviews where I was able to view the user’s facial
         expressions during the interview. I used InVision app for my prototype and the app
         worked very well. I was able to share the prototype with the participants which made
         the interviews run a lot smoother.</p>
      <h2>8 Style Guide</h2>
      <p>After the test results, I analyzed the feedback from the users and I corrected
         the pain points that the users were having and created a design guide to determine
         the style of the app.</p>
      <h2>9 Final Design</h2>
      <p>Initial research showed blue is color which evokes trust with the users.
         I decided to user navy color blue and tints of lighter blue to envoke the
         feeling of trust throughout the application. Allowing the users to feel safe with
         the decision to sign up with the Ex App.</p>
