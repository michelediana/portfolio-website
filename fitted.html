    <p>Fitted is a fitness application to help users to achieve their
      fitness goals. This app was designed for individuals who have a busy
      life schedule or who are new to fitness.
    </p>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Motivate people into an exercise routine that suits their level, schedule, and interests.</p>
    <h2>Role</h2>
    <p>MI lead in designing the user interface and the visual aesthetic of the application.
      Using the project, I was able to communicate the feeling of joy and happiness that the
      client wanted to invoke.

  <!-- Low-Fidelity -->
  <div class="container">
    <h2>1 Low-Fidelity</h2>
    <p>I started my process with low-fidelity wireframes to understand how the text,
      UI elements and overall design of the application layouts.

  <!-- User Flows -->
  <div class="container">
    <h2>2 User Flows</h2>
    <p>Created user flows where I can understand how the users will navigate
      through pages to achieve their tasks.

  <!--  Med-Fidelity Grid -->
    <div class="container">
    <h2>3 Med-Fidelity Grid</h2>
    <p>By creating med-fidelity wireframes I was able to view how elements will
      be laid out in the app and understand the spacing of each element.
    </p>

  <!--  Med-Fidelity -->
    <div class="container">
    <h2>4 Med-Fidelity</h2>
    <p>By creating this fidelity wireframe I was focused on the hierarchy of the layout.
      Figuring out how to establish where the users should focus their attention first and
      help the users navigate their eyes up and down each page.

  <!--  Hi-Fi Wireframes -->
  <div class="container">
    <h2>5 High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
    <p>When creating these wireframes I used colors that were listed in the design
      brief which was orange and black. I used a lot of different shades of orange
      to envoke joy and happiness throughout the application.

  <!--  Revision Fidelity Wireframes -->
  <div class="container">
    <h2>6 Revision Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
    <p>I redesigned the color scheme of the application after viewing the app.
      Replacing the black background with white let the orange pop out more and
      gave the feeling of more happiness and joy.

    <!-- MoodBoard -->
  <div class="container">
    <h2>7 MoodBoard</h2>
    <p>When designing the mood board, I used images that are uplifting and joyful.
       Fitted gives users motivation toward fitness and encouragement.

  <!--  Responsive Design Mockups -->
  <div class="container">
    <h2>8 Responsive Design Mockups</h2>
    <p>Designing for tablet and desktop I stayed consistent with feel and placement
      of the mobile design, causing less friction for users to achieve their objectives
      when attempting their tasks.
