    <h1>Fitted</h1>
    <p>Fitted is a fitness application to help users to achieve their
      fitness goals. This app was designed for individuals who have a busy
      life schedule or who are new to fitness.
    </p>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Motivate people into an exercise routine that suits their level, schedule, and interests.
    </p>
    <h2>Role</h2>
    <p>I lead in designing the user interface and the visual aesthetic of the application.
      Using the project, I was able to communicate the feeling of joy and happiness that the client wanted to invoke.

      <h2>1 Low-Fidelity</h2>
      <p>I started my process with low-fidelity wireframes to understand how the text,
        UI elements and overall design of the application layouts.

      <h2>3 Med-Fidelity Grid</h2>
      <p>By creating med-fidelity wireframes I was able to view how elements will
        be laid out in the app and understand the spacing of each element.

      <p>By creating this fidelity wireframe I was focused on the hierarchy of the layout.
        Figuring out how to establish where the users should focus their attention first and
        help the users navigate their eyes up and down each page.

      <h2>5 High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      <p>When creating these wireframes I used colors that were listed in the design
        brief which was orange and black. I used a lot of different shades of orange
        to envoke joy and happiness throughout the application.

      <h2>6 Revision Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
      <p>I redesigned the color scheme of the application after viewing the app.
        Replacing the black background with white let the orange pop out more and
        gave the feeling of more happiness and joy.
